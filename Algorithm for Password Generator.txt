Algorithm for Password Generator

1. Imports:
   - Import the random module for generating random choices.
   - Import the string module for accessing character constants.

2. Define generate_password function:
   - Initialize lowercase_letters to store all lowercase ASCII letters.
   - Initialize uppercase_letters to store all uppercase ASCII letters.
   - Initialize digits to store all digit characters ('0' to '9').
   - Initialize special_characters to store common punctuation and special characters.
   - Concatenate all these sets into all_characters to encompass all possible characters for the password.
   - Use random.choices to randomly select length number of characters from all_characters.
   - Join these characters into a string to form the `password`.
   - Return the generated `password`.

3. Define main function:
   - Start an indefinite loop (`while True`) to repeatedly prompt the user for input.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Use a try-except block to handle potential ValueError when converting user input to an integer (`length`).
     - Prompt the user to enter the desired length of the password.
     - If the entered length is less than or equal to zero, print an error message and prompt again.
     - If conversion is successful and length is valid, break out of the loop.
     - If conversion fails (invalid input), catch the ValueError and prompt the user to enter a valid integer.
   - Generate a password using generate_password with the validated length.
   - Print the generated password in a user-friendly format.

4. Main Execution Check:
   - Use `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that `main()` function runs only when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).
